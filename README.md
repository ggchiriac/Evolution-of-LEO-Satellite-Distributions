# Evolution-of-LEO-Satellite-Distributions
Our team took 3rd Place in the "Catch a Star" astrophysics research contest, organized by the European Association for Astronomy Education. 

We studied how Low Earth Orbit satellite position probabilities evolved over time due to friction, gravitational effects, and radiation.
