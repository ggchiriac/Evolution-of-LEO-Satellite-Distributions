# Evolution-of-LEO-Satellite-Distributions
Our team took 3rd Place in the "Catch a Star" astrophysics research contest, organized by the European Association for Astronomy Education. 

Making use of Space-Track's database of 73k satellites in orbit, we studied how Low Earth Orbit Satellite position probabilities will evolve over time due to friction, gravitational effects, and radiation.
